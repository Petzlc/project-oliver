# Project Oliver: A Systematic Study of Onomastics and Idiomatic Expressions

## Overview

**Project Oliver** is a comprehensive initiative designed to explore and systematically document the collection of person names, other names (e.g., nicknames, pseudonyms), and idiomatic expressions within a defined group. This project aims to investigate the linguistic and sociocultural significance of onomastics (the study of names) and idiomatic usage, providing valuable insights into the interaction between language, identity, and social norms.

The data gathered in this project will serve as a resource for further linguistic analysis, contributing to fields such as sociolinguistics, ethnography, and communication studies. The goal is to create a robust dataset that supports comparative studies of naming conventions and idiomatic expressions across different social groups.

## Technology Stack

**Project Oliver** is built using **Next.js**, a powerful React-based framework for creating fast and efficient web applications, and **PostgreSQL**, a robust relational database system that stores and manages the collected data.

    - **Next.js** provides the platform for data collection, user interaction, and the overall interface design.
    - **PostgreSQL** is used to store and manage the names, other names, and idioms, enabling efficient querying and analysis of the dataset.

## Objectives

    1. **Collect and catalog** a diverse set of personal names and alternative naming forms (e.g., pseudonyms, titles).
    2. **Document idiomatic expressions** and explore their usage patterns within the group.
    3. **Analyze linguistic tendencies** in name usage and idioms, considering sociocultural influences.
    4. **Establish correlations** between naming conventions, idiomatic usage, and group identity.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

Participants from a targeted social group will be asked to provide the following data:

    - **Personal names** (full name, given name, surname, etc.)
    - **Other names** (nicknames, aliases, titles, etc.)
    - **Idioms commonly** used within the group

### Data Analysis

Data will be systematically categorized and examined using both qualitative and quantitative methods:

    - **Onomastic Analysis**: Categorization of names based on linguistic origin, frequency, and sociocultural connotations.
    - **Idiomatic Analysis**: Examination of idioms, with a focus on metaphorical structures, meaning shifts, and their role in group identity.

### Tools and Techniques

    - **Next.js** facilitates data input and user interaction through a web-based platform.
    - **PostgreSQL** ensures efficient data storage, retrieval, and analysis.
    - Data will be processed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques for pattern recognition and semantic analysis.
    - Statistical methods will be employed to explore correlations between the data sets.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

    1. **Data Collection Module**: Tools for gathering names, other names, and idiomatic expressions.
    2. **Data Analysis Pipeline**: Algorithms for categorizing and analyzing collected data.
    3. **Database Management**: PostgreSQL setup for data storage and management.
    4. **Documentation and Reporting**: A repository for reporting findings and generating visualizations of key data trends.

## Future Research Directions

The outcomes of **Project Oliver** may serve as the basis for future research in:

    - Comparative onomastics across cultures and subgroups
    - The sociolinguistic role of idioms in forming and maintaining group cohesion
    - Longitudinal studies on the evolution of names and idiomatic expressions in response to external social changes

## Conclusion

**Project Oliver** represents a significant step towards a deeper understanding of the intersection between language and social identity. The systematic collection and analysis of person names, alternative names, and idioms—powered by Next.js and PostgreSQL—will contribute to ongoing research in linguistics and cultural studies, offering novel insights into the social functions of language.
